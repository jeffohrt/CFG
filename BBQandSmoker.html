<h1>The BBQ Bucket</h1>
<h2>aka 'The Barbie Bucket'</h2>

<p>This little split from Cooking for Grandpa is a tip of the hat to Chris, Terri and Johnny ... who in 1996 took me in for an entire month, let me sleep on the couch and fed me exclusively a carnivore diet, BBQ'd every day ... except we were all college students too poor to have an actual BBQ.

<p>So they filled an old aluminum bucket with gravel to the perfect height for coals and placed the rack from the oven on top.

<p>They BBQ'd that way the entire summer.

<hr>

<p>Taking yet another huge step towards becoming A) Homeless, B) Recluse / Eccentric or C) Vagrant ... I found that keeping all my BBQ stuff in a trolley in my apartment in the KSA was easier.

<p>PS I had already built a shallow pit and jet stove ... hence the chair and tea kettle.

<div id="Chimneys">
<h2>Chimneys</h2>

<p>A chimney is a straight forward thing yet whenever I make one out of a soup can, people look at me in awe ... it's a chimney, people.

<p>For lighting coal, charcoal or BBQ briquettes there's nothing quite like a tomato juice can chimney.  It's a little trick from my father in the 1970s.  My neighbor and I made them in Malaysia in 2011 when we BBQ'd in aluminum woks set in the top of giant clay pots because that's all we could manage.

<p>Anyway - get a big metal can - old 2 L tomato juice cans were the thing, Francis even found them in Malaysia.  However in the KSA in 2015 the best I could manage was a 'powdered breast milk' can - I think the translation was off and it was just baby formula.

<p>Cut the bottom off with a can opener.  Put 4 notches around the bottom for air to get into.  Fill it and light it from the bottom.

<p>Feel free to use a cheater stick (little block of highly flammable charcoal starter).

<p>The chimney protects the fire from the wind, keeps the heat in and focuses it up through the fuel to light as fast as possible.

<p>Fold that little tab around.
<p><img src="img/BBQ/chimney.4.jpg" width=300px>
<img src="img/BBQ/chimney.5.jpg" width=300px>
<p>4 should be good and be careful not to hit that seam in the can.
<hr>
<p>I find it takes about 30 minutes for the chimney to fire everything up.  When you think it is done, pull the chimney off with tongs.  If the coals are not quite lit up, leave them in the pile.  If they are well lit, spread them around, lay down the grill and start cooking.
<p>Watch for the occasional spark though.

<div id="JetStoves">
<img src="./img/BBQ/jet.bottom.fired.up.jpg" width=300 class="fl">
<h2>Jet Stoves</h2>

<p>A jet is simply a narrow opening, a mix of fuel and air are pumped or drawn (vacuum) through the jet.  The decrease in size causes an increase in speed.  Turbulence causes fuel:air mixing and gives a good clean burn.

<p>My father gave me a European alcohol jet stove when I was about 14.  Other than a novelty, to burn off rubbing alcohol, I never really used it.

<p>For the decade I lived in a car I used an MSR multi-fuel stove.  This was a hand-pumped, pressurized, jet stove that burned anything from alcohol to white-gas to diesel and fuel oil.

<p>When I started working in Asia and the Middle East I saw jet stoves everywhere.  Jet stoves were very popular, particularly among the street-food vendors in Asia as they were extremely fuel efficient.  And an interesting variant kept popping up.  Jet stoves that used solid fuels (wood or coal) making them more like a barrel stove with extra care taken on the proportions to get the air:fuel mix correct.

<img src="./img/BBQ/Bottom.Jet.Barrel.jpg" width=300>
<img src="./img/BBQ/Mid.Jet.Barrel.jpg" width=300>

<p>These are forced air, bottom jet and mid jet barrel stoves from China in 2014.

<p>I spent many an hour at these places, the food was excellent and the people were always very proud to explain how they built theirs.

<p>In 2015 I moved back to the KSA and decided to build a few for my weekly BBQs.

<h2>3:1 with a bottom jet</h2>
<p>This is the standard solid fuel jet stove you will see all over Asia.  I have seen them made from everything from rock and mortar to bricks, oil drums and clay to barrels and concrete.

<h2>3:1 with a drop chamber</h2>

<p>The standard ratio is about 3:1, meaning the height of the opening is 1/3 the height of the structure.  These are usually built with a heat resistant material like stone, brick or clay.

<p>This variant has the jet (opening) halfway up so the coals can drop into a lower chamber but still provide the standard 3:1 ratio.  I find it best for burning wood, twigs etc.

<div id="ShallowPitBBQ">
<h2>Shallow Pit BBQ</h2>

<p>These are your standard fire pits.  Dig a slight indentation, line it with rocks or bricks and you are done.

<p>Here are some variants from the KSA in 2015.

<p><img src="./img/BBQ/small.pit.1.jpg" width=300>
<img src="./img/BBQ/small.pit.2.jpg" width=300>

<p>Notice that some have a large flat slab base - those are marble slabs from a local hotel demolition.  Look close enough and you can see the heat fractures from me cooking with them.

<img src="./img/BBQ/shallow.pit.2.jpg" width=200>
<img src="./img/BBQ/shallow.pit.3.jpg" width=200>

<p>From these images you can see the extra coal left over from the last session.  I do douse my fires but they dry out very quickly.  It is 50&deg;C here all the time.
<p>Also, the coal tends to smell of fish when you are done BBQing fish so no sense bringing it back inside.  Normally I scoop it up and use it again if it is dry enough.

<p>Notice I used extra bricks in the front to level things up.

<div id="Smoked">
<h2>Hot Smoke or Cold Smoke</h2>
<h3>... Grandpa absolutely could not have any ...</h3>

<p>Hot Smoking uses a temp over 80 &deg;C and cooks (denatures) the proteins and renders the fat while dehydrating and smoking.  Hot Smoking typically is done until the object is cooked ... a few hrs at most.

<p>Hot Smoking is usually done with a smoke temp of 100+ &deg; C (225 &deg;F).  This is used to raise the internal temp to 80 &deg;C (180 F) where it is held for atleast 30 min.  Small pieces can be done in hrs ... large pieces can take 12 hrs or more.

<p>Cold Smoking use a smoke temp under 80 &deg;C (175 &deg;F).  It is used to raise the internal temp to 60-70 &deg;C (140-150 &deg;F)  It cooks (denatures) the proteins but does NOT render the fat ... it dehydrates and smokes.  Cold smoking can take 12 hrs or longer.

<p>Brent Woolard has excellent vids on Youtube.  This is how he built the smoke machine for his favorite smoker.

<p>&rarr; 3 inch pipe, 1 foot long, screen in the bottom
<p>&rarr; small aquarium air pump with a split line.  1 line goes into the bottom, bellow the screen, and blows air onto the coals to keep them lit.  1 line goes into the top and blows the smoke across to the intake pipe for the smoker.

<p>There are many, many kinds of smokers.  In 2015, 17 and 18 I smoked with my Uncle and his little Bradley smoker.

<p>It had 4 racks and could hold 3 dozen whole kiack or 4 dozen fillets (2 dozen fish).  The pucks were 20 min each or $12 for 24 (8 hrs).  That is what it took to smoke kiack, mackerel, salmon etc.

<p>In 2019 I built a custom smoke house for a family.  It was 4x4x8 and the smoke chamber was a hole in the ground 12 ft away.  Smoke was cooled and piped in.

<p>This smoke house burned a mix of seasoned and green hard wood.  It took 4 days to smoke whole kiack and cost $5 to $7 a day in wood depending on weather and such.  A 4 day run cost $20-$30 dollars.  That's 2 to 3 times what the Bradley cost but we could fit 10 times the fish in it.

<p>Doing 400 kiack with the custom house was a single run over 4 days and cost $30 at most.  The Bradley would have cost $100-$120 in pucks and taken the same 4 days.

<p>Late in 2019 we dug out the pit smoke chamber, lined it with stone and mortar and then topped it with a barrel roof and steel door.  This made it much more efficient and it took 3 days, not 4, to smoke meats.  This saved time and money.
