<h1>2:1 ... Water : Rice</h1>

<p>Rice is pretty straight forward.  The ratio is 2:1, so if you want 3ish cups of cooked rice, you need 1 cup of uncooked rice and 2 cups of water.  That ratio might change a tad from brand to brand so check the labels.  Instant rice is also a different ratio, so check the box.

<p>The rice will expand a bit as it cooks, hence 2+1 = 3ish.

<p>All things being equal, I like old school rice.

<hr>
<p>&rarr; Guestimate finished desired volume (or pick a random container, can or cup)
<p>&rarr; Use ratio of 1 rice : 2 water to measure out rice and water
<p>&rarr; Wash the rice several times before cooking (rinse until water is clear - the cloudy, dusty stuff is mostly starch)
<p>&rarr; Bring rice, water and your choices of goodness (Butter, Spices etc) to a boil
<p>&rarr; Reduce to simmer (lowest setting will do) and cover for 10-15 minutes.
<hr>
<p>&rarr; With small amounts of seafood or light fish, bring rice to boil, turn down to simmer and place fish on top before covering.  This will poach the fish very nicely.
<p>&rarr; With larger amounts of seafood or fish, my Grandmother insists you fry it in a frying pan first, however I have been known to add a little extra water and boil the goodness until cooked, then begin the rice cycle.
<p>&rarr; I've also been known to fry up bacon, garlic and onions in the pot prior to making the rice.
