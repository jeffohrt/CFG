<h1>Canning</h1>

<p>Canning uses a water bath to cook (denature proteins, render fat, pasteurize) food in glass jars with special lids that 'snap' down to show they are properly sealed.

<p>Pasteurisation is 70&deg;C for 2 min.  This kills all normal bacteria, including botulism but not botulism spores.  The botulism toxin is destroyed quickly after 80&deg;C.  Killing the spores takes superheated water; 15 PSI (121 &deg;C) for 3 min or 10 PSI (115 &deg;C) for longer.  Thus most canning processes are much longer to ensure it is done.

<p>This can't be done in a normal pot at normal pressures.  <i><b>The exception to this is highly acidic foods - like pickles - the acidity kills the spores.</b></i>

<p>The pressure process can be done in a specialty pot often called a pressure canner.

<h2>Soups</h2>

<p><i>Some people pre-cook, slightly more than blanching, the ingredients as an entire soup and then can to complete cooking.  Others pack raw, can and must finish cooking when unsealed.</i>

<ul>
<li><p>Pack jars with soup.
<li><p>Leave normal headspace.
<li><p>Seal and Can normally in a pressure canner.
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Meat - lean</h2>

<p><i>Some people brown their meat first in a frying pan to allow them to pour off as much fat as they wish.</i>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove as much fat as possible.
<li><p>Pack jars with stew meat or ground meat (hamburger).
<li><p>Leave additional headspace.
<li><p>Add water to cover meat and fill to normal headspace.
<li><p><i>Meat will sink after canning, fat will float.</i>
<li><p>Seal and Can normally in a pressure canner.
</ul>

<h2>Meat - reg</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Pack jars with stew meat or ground meat (hamburger).
<li><p>Leave additional headspace for the extra fat.
<li><p><i>Meat will sink after canning, fat will float.</i>
<li><p>Seal and Can normally in a pressure canner.
</ul>


<h2>Meatloaf</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Mix up your standard meatloaf recipe.
<li><p>Pack the meatloaf into quart jars leaving twice the normal headspace.
<li><p>DON'T add water, the extra fat will fill the additional headspace.
<li><p>Seal and Can normally in a pressure canner.
</ul>

<h2>Baked Beans</h2>
<p>I tried raw packing baked beans, after soaking them out.  Even at 2/3 beans and 1/3 liquid, the cans were still too dry when finished.  50/50 might work.  I'll have to try it sometime.
