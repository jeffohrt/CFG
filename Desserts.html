<h1>Coconut Cream Pie started it all</h1>
<h2><i>... and other desserts ...</i></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>It was a standing practice in the family, whenever the children "from away" came by, there would be a list of chores for us to do in exchange for our favorite foods.

<p>As the cooks aged and arthritis set in, that shifted to us coming to do chores and bringing our favorite foods.

<p>But when Grandpa's diet kicked in full strength even the favorite foods got banished.

<p>Grandma had been making me mincemeat pies for 4 decades ... I had been bringing Grandpa coconut cream pies, his absolute favorite, for well over two decades when, in 2015, word on high came down ... no more pie ... too much salt ... blah blah blah ...

<p>That is what started my cooking for Grandpa that summer - I needed to learn to make coconut cream pie filling, from scratch, with no salt.

<p>It turned out to be easy so I set about teaching myself as much as I could ... with Grandpa making suggestions all the way along ... and that all ended in us writing a cookbook ... this cookbook.

<h1>Coconut Cream Pie Base</h1>
<ul>
<p>1 cup sweetened shredded / flaked coconut
<p>3 cups Blend (half-and-half)
<p>2 eggs (beaten)
<p>3/4 cup sugar
<p>1/2 cup all-purpose flour
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</ul>
<p>Heat the oven to 350, then turn off.  Spread coconut on a cookie sheet and brown in cooling oven &#8211; stir once or twice or until brown.
<p>Bring to a boil on low heat, or in a double boiler (it is easier, but takes longer), simmer Blend, eggs, sugar and flour.  Stir constantly and watch the edges / corners for flour lumps.
<p>When it boils and is nice and thick remove from heat and stir in browned coconut and vanilla.
<p>Pour into serving dishes and chill.

<h2>Variations</h2>
<ul>
<p>Grandpa likes sugar, I do not.
<p>Cut back on the sugar and throw in some raisins.
</ul>

</div>
<div id="BreadPudding">
<h2>Bread Pudding Base</h2>
<ul>
<p>6-8+ slices of STALE / DRY bread
<p>2 tablespoons of butter / margarine
<p>4 eggs (beaten)
<p>2 cups of milk
<p>3/4 cup of sugar
<p>1 teaspoon of cinnamon
<p>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
</ul>
<p>The bread needs to be stale / dry.  Fresh bread does not cook up properly.
<p>Mix everything except bread in the casserole dish you will bake it in (I am a one-pot-wonder).  When well mixed, start adding bread.
<p>Tear the bread into small pieces.  Drop it in the liquid and mix well.  Add bread until the liquid is absorbed or the casserole dish is 90% full.
<p>Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

<p><img src="./img/bread.pudding.1.jpg" width=300px><img src="./img/bread.pudding.2.jpg" width=300px>

<h2>Variations</h2>
<ul>
<p>Grandpa like extra raisins, I like no sugar.
<p>Grandpa often has to use plain, no-salt, bread made especially for him.
<p>I like making it from stale raisin bread.
<p>Dried cranberries are good, as is substituting sweetened shredded coconut for sugar.

<div id="Cobbler">
<h1>Cobbler & Grunt</h1>
<p>Cobbler is a pie with a top but no shell / bottom.  Hence it is more than pudding but less than a true and proper pie.

<p>Grunt - as in blue berry grunt - is just a variation of a cobbler.

<div id="Ganache">
<h1>Campground Fondue aka Ganache</h1>

<h3>I lived in a car for a decade, during my 20s and early 30s.  During this time I invented 'Campground Fondue' which amounted to cobbling a double boiler together and melting chocolate bars with a bit of milk and butter.</h3>

<h3>Campground Fondue was a hit all through Asia and the Middle East through my 30s and 40s.  No-one told me it had another name.</h3>

<h3>I was disappointed to discover, at 45, that my Campground Fondue was called Ganache and was commonly used to top cakes and desserts.</h3>

<hr>
<p>&rarr; Cut fat into all dry ingredients until it resembles wet sand.
<p>&rarr; Add 4 tablespoons of ice water and work into dough. (Add more water / flour as needed).
<p>&rarr; Don't over-work, if dough gets too warm the fat will start to run.  Chill it in the fridge or freezer and continue.
<p>&rarr; Divide into 2 parts, chill in fridge for at least 1 hr up to 2 days.
<hr>
<p>&rarr; Take chilled dough and roll on a floured surface until large enough to fill pie plate with 1 inch of overhang.  (9 inch standard pie plate needs a circle of 14 inches.)
<p>&rarr; Gently form to pie plate.  Trim edges, crimp to rim of plate.  Cover with plastic and freeze for later.  Store in fridge if using shortly.

<hr>
<p>&rarr; For non-bake pies (like custard, chocolate pudding or coconut cream), if shell is frozen go straight to pricking and the oven.
<p>&rarr; For non-bake pies, if shell is fresh, chill in fridge for a hr or the freezer for 30 min.  (This is important to prevent the sides from softening and slipping down the plate before baking solid.)  Then prick shell repeatedly with a fork.

<p>&rarr; Bake at 425&deg;F (220&deg;C) for 8 min.

<hr>
<p>&rarr; For pies you bake, like sweet-potato, fill the raw pie shell with pie filling and wrap in plastic (and freeze) or bake according to pie filling requirements.


<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>* 2 1/2 cups of flour will make a 9 inch double crust (1 shell + 1 cover), 2 9 inch crusts or a 10 inch crust.
<p>** Many of the churches I volunteered at often had 'pie sales' in which the entire pie was raw (or frozen) and delivered to the customers who then baked it.  I spent a whole winter making apple pies this way with my mother's church the winter I lived with her because of (her) knee surgeries.
<p>*** Egg Wash - 1 egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of cream, blend or milk.  Mix and brush onto shell just prior to baking.

<div id="PotatoCandy">
<h1>Potato Candy</h1>

<p>Original recipes were ludicrously sweet - with a 10:1 powdered sugar to potato ratio.</p>
<p>I find 50/50 too sweet.  But anyway - mix left over mashed potatoes (without the milk and butter) with your preference in terms of the amount of icing sugar.</p>

<p>&rarr; Mix that adding potato, water or powdered sugar until it forms a putty like dough.</p>
<p>&rarr; Put a layer of wax paper on a cookie sheet, sprinkle with powdered sugar and roll the dough out to a 1/4 inch thick</p>
<p>&rarr; Leave the top bare or spread a thin layer of melted chocolate, a thin layer of peanut butter (or other nut butter) or even a thin layer of Nutello</p>
<p>&rarr; Put it in the fridge to stiffen up a bit ... or while still warm, roll it and slice it like sticky buns.</p>

<p>* This can be frozen.  As a kid I would stew and freeze rhubarb.  It was a favorite to add over the top of ice-cream.
<p>** Most recipes call for 'fresh' rhubarb (ie not stewed).  If you wash, chop and dry off your rhubarb, you can freeze it in bags to use as 'fresh' rhubarb later.  For convenience, I freeze it in 2 cup alotments as most recipes call for 2 cups which is now 1 bag.

<h1>Shelley's Cheese Cake</h1>

<p>I went to public school with Shelley, from Gr 2 to 12 ... but it was my younger sister that fell madly in love with Shelley's favorite lunch item.  A home-made cheese cake.
<p>My sister would beg, borrow or steal anything to trade for some of the cheese cake.  Shelley must have gone home and told her mother once or twice because one day Shelley came to school with the recipe.  Her mother sent it to my mother, so my sister could have cheese cake.

<p>&rarr; 1/4 cup of melted margerine (or butter)
