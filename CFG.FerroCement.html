<h1>Home In The Earth</h1>
<ul>
<li>https://www.homeintheearth.com/
<li>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKo1x0vX-wajgcoD85r6moA
<li>massive single build of monolithic ferrocement earth home
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 ton of #4 rebar, 9 inch centers for main slab
<li>galvanized, perforated metal studs (9 ft), bolted to track, track bolted to foundation
<li>hardware cloth (they call it lathe) on inside of studs
<li>steel strapping on outside of studs
<li>added 20 ft studs for 2nd floor
<li>added 26 ft studs for 'the tower'
<li>lacing #5 (5/8) rebar horizontally and vertically through studs (looks like 1 ft centers)
<li>rebar 2 inches from lathe (hardware cloth)
<li>shotcrete blown from both sides - looks several inches thick on both layers
<li>cured for a week, brushed / swept and waterproofed outside
<li>drain tile / pipe around foundation, covered in pea gravel
<li>backfilled to 4', added earth tubes for geothermal heat / cooling
<li>backfilled another 4'
<li>septic went in
<li>garage slab, #4 rebar
<li>well drilled, 185 ft, 50 gal per min
<li>corrogated steel garage
</ul>

<dt>Ferrocement House Project - Part 2 - Starting the Build
<dd>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRwDEp7zBDc
<dd>re-watch to see rebar layout of dome to control shell thickness

<ul>
<li>french drain surrounds house
<li>no real engineering info
</ul>

<dt>Ferrocement House Project - Part 3 - MUDS UP! Work Footage
<dd>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtl7VjLavhk
<dd><ul>
<li>house half buried
<li>ferrocement retaining walls used to contain soil, reduce erosion
<li>horse and cow panels are ideal for vertical retaining wall but no good for compound curves in a dome
<li>monolithic build - shell is all one piece - cold joints don't count - stress is distributed as a single shell
</ul>



<dt>Ferrocement House Project - Part 7 - Framing The Armature (retaining wall and stairs)
<dd>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJm1Ysc6Lik
<dd>
<ul>
<li>0.5 inch rebar as needed to hold 4 inch cattle panel in place, panel on outside
<li>0.5 inch hardware cloth on outside
<li>0.5 inch expanded mesh (slightly heavier than hardware cloth) on inside
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>older sections of wall use 1 inch hardware cloth and 1 inch expanded mesh
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>uses 'pig tail' wire and spinny handtool to attach
<li>top of wall done with custom fab 3/8 rebar supports to make level, smooth, flowing curve to wall
<li>claims that welding rebar weakens it - welds anyway
</ul>

<dt>Ferrocement House Project - Part 8 - Wrapping The Armature
<dd>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOxR1_NcOic
<hr>
<dd>Bob Foote FerroCement Guru history lesson
<dd><ul>
<li>finished wall 1 inch thick
<li>3/8 inch rebar
<li>6 inch 're-mesh'
<li>hardware cloth
<li><i>can replace mesh or cloth with 2 layers of chicken wire</i>
<li>rebar on 1 ft centers for walls, less than that on domes
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>uses 'pig tail' wire and spinny handtool to attach - pig tails are 17 gauge wire
<li>Doug Lacey from 'Shambalah Village' uses pneumatic hog ring pliers
</ul>

<dt>Ferrocement House Project - Part 9 - Cement Sand Fibers Glue
<dd>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DLe5GJ10CY

<dd>
<ul>
<li>washed sand - no silt or organic (organic matter will erode concrete in only a few yrs)
<li>normal concrete = 1 part portland cement, 2 parts washed sand, 3 parts gravel
<li>Type 1 Portland kicks in 30 min, Type 2 kicks in 60
<li>Huttash = 2 parts washed sand, 1 part portland cement = mortar or mud
<li>fibre reinforced ferrocement - 1 lb fibre per cubic yard cement
<li>1/2 bag cement is 2 inches shy of a 5 gal bucket
<li>acrylic concrete glue - a few glugs for each batch as a conditioner, twice that for cold joints
</ul>

<dt>Ferrocement House Project - Part 10 - Retaining wall and Starting the Roof
<dd>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dil0IId5p4
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Huttash can do 1.5 bags of cement in a good day, his dad averaged 2 when he was that age
<li>the fibres make the mud much easier to work with but must be added slowly to mixer
<li>fibres prevent cracking in the finished concrete but cause the concrete to kick faster
<p>&rarr; so much faster infact, Huttash, solo, can't use a 1/2 bag mix fast enough ... he and another person could, but solo batches will need a setting retarder
<li>the perfect mud will 'slide and flop' in the mixer
<li>hose down concrete 2-3 times a day for 2-3 days while it cures slowly for extra strength
</ul>
