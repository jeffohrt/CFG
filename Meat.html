<p>&rarr; fry it in bacon fat

<h2>Rinella's Heart Marinade</h2>

<p>Rinella recommends coring the heart after trimming the fat.  If a marinade is to be used, he recommends using olive oil as the liquid as heart is extremely lean meat.  His general suggestion was olive oil, a little vinegar and Montreal style spices.  He's also fond of vacuum sealing his marinading meat, believing the vacuum (neg pressure) helps pull the marinade into the meat as well as reducing the amount of marinade needed.

<h2>Rinella's Pickled Heart</h2>

<p>&rarr; trim the fat
<p>&rarr; slice thin, poach in stock
<p>&rarr; then brine - don't brine raw heart - he doesn't tell you until the end - he's canning it

<p>&rarr; brine is vinegar, salt, sugar and spices

<p>30 lbs of meat, 4 quarts of Cowboy Candy, 1 cup vinegar, 1/4 salt, 1/2 cup pepper, 2 tablespoons cummin seeds



<h2>Biltong</h2>

<p>Biltong is a spiced, dried, thinnly sliced meat.

<p>Biltong should have some fat in it, particularly a ribbon of fat like bacon.

<p>Any cut can be used.  Beef is best, beef adjacent (deer, moose, etc) and pork is the least desirable.  Traditionalists use kudu.

<p>&rarr;Slice meat into 1 cm thick slices - cut with the grain.  Laying out a single layer in a large flat pan.

<p>&rarr; Hang meat to dry in a well ventilated, insect-proof, container.  Make sure the meat doesn't touch each other.
<p>Biltong can take up to a week to dry completely.  3-4 days is more usual.  Commercially produced biltong is made with heat in a few hrs.  A dehydrator will also do the trick.
<p>&rarr;When nearly, completely dry (still soft to the touch in the thickest part), slice thinly across the grain.

<dt><p>Biltong Box A)
<dd><p>Use a large plastic tupperware container - use one that is much wider than it is tall.
<dd><p>Cut holes (2) in the lower right corners.  Seal with cheese cloth or similar.  The goal is to let fresh air in without insects.
<dd><p>Cut 1 hole in the lid (top) on the opposite side of box.  Cover with cheese cloth and a computer fan or similar.  The goal is for the fan to pull air out of the box.  drawing fresh air in through the bottom, through the meat and out the top.
<dd><p>Hang the meat across the box, across the top, make sure the meat isn't touching.
<p>Newspaper or papertowel in the bottom is a good idea as the meat will drip vinegar and once the salt starts working, will sweat fluid as it dries.

<dt><p>Biltong Box B)

<dd><p>Use a large tupperware container - one that is much taller than it is wide.
<dd><p>Cut a hole very near the bottom, seal with cheese cloth to prevent insects.
<dd><p>Put a small heat source in the bottom, a small incandescent (hot) lightbulb works.
<p>Use tinfoil to make a 'catch tray' so the vinegar or meat sweats don't hit the heat source.
<dd><p>Put many small holes, sealed with cheese cloth in the top to prevenet insects.
<dd><p>Hang the meat in 1 or 2 layers at the top making sure nothing touches.
<dd><p>The warm air will naturally rise and dry the biltong.

<h2>Alouettes (sans Tetes)</h2>
<p>This literally means, in French, a lark (bird) without a head.  The famous french song actually describes how to butcher and prepare the birds to be cooked.
<p>In the meat world it refers to a bacon sized / shaped cut of meat that is heavily spiced / marinated, wrapped in bacon and goodness, then baked on a long slow heat.  This tenderizes otherwise very tough cuts of meat.  Think bacon wrapped scallops.
<p>Bake them in the oven at 350 &deg;F until done

<h2>Nikku</h2>
<p>Nikku is a First Nation's traditional meat jerky.  Lean cuts of meat are cut to bacon shape and thickness.  They are hung in the sun until dried.
<p>A modern equivalent is made by slicing meat thin, like bacon, lightly salting both sides and laying it out flat on a baker's cooling rack.  Then suspending it near a wood stove or similar dry heat source.

<h2>Pansawan</h2>
<p>Pansawan is a First Nations' traditional dried, smoked meat.

<div id="MeatPies">
<h1>Meat Pies</h1>

<h2>Standing Pies</h2>

<p>Standing pies are made with a crust that is self-supporting.  It does not need a traditional pie shell.

<p>This dough is quite a bit different from a dessert pie shell.  The wet ingredients are boiled and added to the dry ingredients, making a stiff play-dough consistency that holds it's shape even when filled with goodness.

<blockquote>
<h2>Option A - Butter / Lard and NO eggs</h2>

<p>Boil the following equal parts water and fat (butter, lard or butter and lard).
<p><i>As a rough guide, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup fat and 2 1/2 cups of flour makes 2 small pie shells with lids but twice that amount (1 cup water, 1 cup fat, 5 cups flour) for a normal 8 inch pie shell with top.</i>

<h2>Option B - Butter / Lard with Eggs</h2>

<p>Boil water and fat at 2:1.
<p><i>1.5 cups water + 3/4 cup fat = 9 inch shell with top</i>
<p>Mix with flour at 3:1.
<p><i>2.25 cups water/fat + 6 cups flour = 9 inch shell with top</i>

<p>When mixed and cooled (so as not to cook the eggs), add 2 eggs per 9 inch pie shell)

</blockquote>

<p>&rarr; add salt and pepper to taste

<p><i>&rarr; adding water or flour as needed to make play-dough consistency</i>

<p>&rarr; Kneed the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 minutes

<p>&rarr; NO EGG versions must rest, covered with a damp cloth for 4-6 hrs, overnight is better while the EGG versions only need to rest for 5-10 min

<p>&rarr; for small pies, roll the dough out thin enough to make a lid and cut the lid with a water glass or coffee cup, use the remaining dough to form the pie shell around the base of the same glass, thus the lid fits perfectly.

<p>&rarr; for large pies use an 8 or 9 inch cake pan or plate and a knife to cut out the top and bottom of the shells 1/4 - 3/8 inch thick, then roll out the 1/2 inch thick ribbon for the wall (height).

<p>&rarr; for both large and small pie shells, any extra dough can be used for embellishments (leaves, flowers, lid handles etc) 

<p><i>allow the dough to cool (chill in the fridge) before assembling a large pie shell</i>

<p>&rarr; small pies can be assembled, filled, sealed (with steam slits) and baked all in one go

<p>&rarr; large pies must have the bottom and sides assembled, glued with egg wash, with the lid separate, this must be baked for 10-15 min at 450&deg;F to set it before filling it with goodness and baking to completion.

</div>
<div id="MinceMeat">
<h1>Mincemeat</h1>

<p>Mincemeat was traditionally used to clean up scraps from a recently butchered animal so nothing went to waste.  My grandmother use to make it from scratch from deer, moose or caribou; whatever my uncle shot and brought home.
<p>As an adult, when I came home for visits, mincemeat pies were the top of my list of food orders for Grandma (family always called in food orders when we came home).
<p>Over time, and arthritis, mincemeat pies shifted to store bought shells, then tarts, then store bought mincemeat and tart shells.
<p>On his last Father's Day my grandpa (93, 1/3 of 1 kidney and a ridiculous diet) managed to sneak 3 of the <i>Jeff just mowed the lawn mincemeat tarts</i>.  Grandma threw a fit because Grandpa was not allowed any salt at all and the mincemeat had 6% and the shells 10%.
<p>So I asked for the mincemeat recipe and after being told it was too much work, I just downloaded a dozen recipes from the internet.  Going through them I looked for common themes and pulled my first crockpot mincemeat out of thin air in about 90 minutes.

<h2>Mincemeat Theory</h2>

<p>Mincemeat is a 2 step process.  In the 1st step the meat is ground and stewed down with fresh fruit, especially apples.  Stewing is accelerated using an immersion blender to puree the mixture as the liquid cooks off.
<p>When it is oatmealish in consistency, add sugar, allspice (mimics cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves) and add dried fruit to soak up the remaining liquid as it bakes the flavor through everything.

<h1>Crockpot Mincemeat Attempt 1</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>0.5 kg (1 lb) lean ground beef
<li><p>0.5 kg (1 lb) peeled cored apples (2 or 3 big Red Delicious)
<li><p>all the fresh fruit you want
<ul>
<li><p>1 rnd pint of fresh blueberries; remove tops, wash them and throw them in
<li><p>1 rnd pint of fresh cherries; remove pits, stems and throw them in
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Stew on low to cook off water.  Use an immersion blender to puree.
<p>Stew to thick oatmeal consistency.

<p>Transfer to a crockpot.

<p>Add dried fruit (different raisins, cranberries etc) to soak up the extra liquid.
<ul>
<li><p>1 cuppish of yellow raisins
<li><p>1 cuppish of black raisins
<li><p>1 cuppish of cranberries
</ul>

<p>Add Sugar and Spice
<ul>
<li><p>1 cup brown sugar (too much for me but good for Grandpa)
<li><p>1 rnd tablespoon of allspice
</ul>
<p>Cook in the crockpot, on high, with the lid off, while stirring occasionally.
<p>If there is too much liquid after an hr or 2, add more dried fruit.
<p>Taste and add sugar and allspice to suit yourself.

<p>This produced 1 full casserole dish in 3 hrs.

<p>My panel of judges tried it and was impressed with a blind attempt, they even took half.  However they returned half and suggested I bake it for a couple hours with a little more water and some vinegar; to soften up some raisins and cut a little of the brown sugar.

<h2>Rinella Venison & Black Bear Mince Meat Pie</h2>

</div>

<div id="Sausage">

<p>Sausages are just ground meat with a little extra fat and a lot of spices.  In my childhood, this was done with a hand crank meat grinder and a hand held sausage stuffer.  As we got older, more and more often we just froze the loose sausage meat rather than stuff it into skins.  By the time I finished high school, the family just had the butcher do it all.  Pigs, deer, moose ... didn't matter ... it all went to the butcher and came back pre-packaged and ready to freeze.

<p>In 2021 friends and I picked up lean, boneless pork loins at $2/lb.  We cut it with 20% pork fat from our own pigs and made sausages.  They turned out great.  We stuffed half into sausage casings ... it was expensive.  We used 33 mm casings for the huge dinner sausages.

<div class="solid">
<h2>Rinella's Wild Game Sausages</h2>
<p>&rarr; 2 lbs moose (from the one that tried to kill Rinella)
<p>&rarr; 1 lb black bear back fat (so marbled the end product is 75% moose / bear and 25% bear fat)
<p>&rarr; keep everything extremely cold
<p>&rarr; 1 1/2 cup roasted red peppers
<p>&rarr; add sugar, salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, paprika, toasted / pulverized fennel and coriander
<p>&rarr; mix everything before grinding
<p>&rarr; grind coarse
<p>&rarr; mix and grind fine
<p>&rarr; add 1/3 cup frigid red wine
<p>&rarr; stuff into casings

<p>Rinella cased his entire batch as a single coil and then baked it as such in the oven, getting core temp to >160&deg;F because of the bear meat
</div>

<div id="ScotchEggs">

<p>Scotch Eggs are hard boiled eggs, wrapped in sausage meat, breaded and then deep fried.

<dt>Black Bears
<dd><p>We never really shot black bears growing up - Brad - a friend of the family - ran a bear guiding outfit and he always traded all the bear meat we'd want for this and that.
<p>In University, and living out west in my 20s, I always had to barter for moose and bear.

<p>Rinella says to remove as much fat as possible as it is volatile and goes racid easily and quickly.  He suggests keeping the pure lard to render as lard.  He suggests keeping the dirtier fat (meat and blood and such) as a deep fryer oil.

<p>*** Rinella says not to age bear meat - the fat will go off.  He says to be careful keeping un-rendered bear fat in the freezer longer than 6 months.  However, rendered, it freezes for a long time.

<dt>Rabbits
<dd>
<p>Growing up we always shot or snared wild rabbits (snowshoe hares).  Skinned them out, kept the hearts, livers and kidneys.  The main meat was soaked overnight in water and baking soda.</p>
<p>Bunnies were then destined to 2 things - parboiled, boned out, fried in onions and bacon for a rabbit hash or stew.

<h2>Rinella (Hank Shaw's) Sardinia Rabbit Stew</h2>

<p>Quarter the hare, fry it in olive oil, onions, garlic, capers and spices.  And water and braise.  Finish off with spices to taste and a little red wine vinegar.
