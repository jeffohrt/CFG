<h1>Soups, Stews and Chowders</h1>

<p>Soups and Stews - everything you like in a pot, add water, go, go, go.</p>
<p>The truth is not far off that.  The only real variation is water vs stock (meat or veg) and the order things are put in and boiled or simmered.  The goal is for everything to be finished together and as crunchy or soft as peeps desire.</p>
<p>The difference between a soup and stew is the amount of liquid.  Soups have a broth while stews are more of a gravy.  Chowders use a cream or milk.
</div>
<div id="CabbageRoll">
    <h2>Cabbage Roll Soup</h2>
    <p>&rarr; brown ground meat in the bottom of the soup pot, use a little water to prevent it from sticking</p>
    <p>&rarr; add 1-2 cups of rice and cook with the appropriate amount of water - or more if you like thinner soups</p>
    <p>&rarr; add pasta and enough water to cook it, or more if you like thinner soups</p>
    <p>&rarr; add pasta sauce, tomato soup, diced cabbage, diced onion</p>
    <p>&rarr; add water to make as thin as desired</p>
    <p>&rarr; simmer until cabbage is done</p>
    <p>&rarr; add salt, pepper, hot sauce and spices as desired</p>
</div>


<div id="Chowder">
<h2>Chowder Base</h2>
<p>&rarr; wash, peel and dice potato (this is 2/3 the vol of finished chowder)
<p>&rarr; simmer until potato is almost done, dice an onion or two, add and simmer until potato and onion are done
<p>&rarr; minimize water, just enough to barely cover potato

<table>
<tr><td>Corn Chowder</td><td>&rarr; add cream corn, simmer and mix well<p>&rarr; some peeps fry bacon and add</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clam, Seafood,<br>Lobster or Fish Chowder</td><td><p>&rarr; fry seafood in bacon, add to base, simmer and mix well</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&rarr; simmer and mix well keeping liquid to a minimum
<p>At this point it's 'soup' and will freeze well.  You can add cream, simmer and serve.  I like to refridgerate, taking just enough for a meal, heating it, adding cream and eating just that.  By limiting the cream to when you heat just what you want, it keeps longer in the fridge.
<p>I have an uncle that adds butter when he adds cream.

</div>

<div id="MinselSoup">
<h2>Minsel Soup</h2>
<p>Make a chowder base with potato, onions and garlic.  When the base is done, add pasta (like macaroni) and lunenburg pudding (liver pate), simmer until pasta is done.
</div>

<div id="PeanutSoup">
    <h2>West African Peanut Soup or Stew</h2>
    <p>Random person at a fav coffee shop told me about this.  Looked it up, tried it out and added it to the book.</p>
    
    <p><i>*** Tried this once - sweet potato and peanut butter are crazy over-powering.  Dial it back a bit.</i></p>
  
<hr>
<p><i>Some peeps start by dicing and pan frying chicken.</i>
<hr>    
<p>&rarr; bring water or stock to a boil, add diced onion, grated ginger and garlic for a soup
<p>... add diced sweet potato for a stew
<p>&rarr; simmer for 15-20 min
<hr>
<p>&rarr; add peanut butter
<p>&rarr; add chopped tomato (soup) or tomato paste (stew) or both
<p>&rarr; stir well
<hr>
<p>&rarr; add veg (as desired - kale is very good, as are bell peppers)

<hr>

<p>&rarr; simmer until veg are cooked
<p>&rarr; add hot sauce to taste, sprinkle with chopped peanuts as it is plated
