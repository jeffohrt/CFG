<div id="Intro">
<p>For the decade or so that I lived in a car in western Canada, one of my favorite regular house parties was 'baking bread with Bill'.

<p>It was an afternoon of drinking, stories and puttering about with different bread recipes.  Everything was made from scratch.
</div>
<div id="Artisanal">
<h1>Artisanal</h1>
<p>Nothing to see here.  The only difference between artisanal and normal yeast breads appears to be the use of a greased casserole dish instead of a bread pan.
<p>The casserole dish works quite well.  Leave the lid on for most of the baking process.  Take it off for the last few minutes to brown the crust.
</div>
<div id="Biscuits">
<h1>Biscuits</h1>

<p>My Grandpa Ohrt was an absolute master of making these biscuits in a cast iron frying pan over an open fire when we went camping as kids.

<p>&rarr; 2 cups flour
<p>&rarr; 1-2 tablespoon baking powder
<p>&rarr; 1/2 cup shortening

<p>Cut shortening in with a fork.  Mix thoroughly until it resembles course crumbs.

<p>&rarr; 3/4 cup milk

<p>Mix in milk.  Dough should be soft and slightly moist.

<p>(add) Flour and work until soft and dry.

<p>&rarr; roll into a 1/2 inch sheet and cut with a cookie cutter.  Re-roll scraps and cut until consumed.

<p>&rarr; pre-heat and bake on ungreased pan @450 &deg;F or 230 &deg;C until golden (about 10 min).

<h2><u>Variations</u></h2>

<p>&rarr; You can use 1:1 butter or margarine (85% fat) for shortening (100% fat) but the texture will be a bit off.
<p>&rarr; Add all the fruits and nuts you like.
<p>&rarr; Add a (packed) cup of cold, cooked, sweet potatoes.

</div>
<div id="Cornbread">
<h1>Cornbread</h1>
<p>Cornbread is another personal favorite.  An old friend from college use to make me blueberry cornbread.

<ul>
<p>1/4 cup butter / margarine (melted)
<p>1 cup milk
<p>1 large egg
<p>1 1/4 cups cornmeal
<p>1 cup all-purpose flour
<p>1/3 cup sugar
<p>1 tablespoon baking powder
</ul>
<p>Mix everything together.  Spoon into greased muffin pan, fill each cup 1/2 to 2/3 full.  Bake at 350 for 20 to 30 min, use the toothpick test to check when they are done.

<h2>Variations</h2>
<ul>
<p>More sugar for Grandpa, less for me.
<p>Add berries, raisins or dried cranberries as desired.
<p>Add 1 cup fresh chopped rhubarb, 1/2 cup extra sugar.
</ul>

<h2>Very Variations</h2>

<p>Double everything, mix everything except flour until smooth.  Add and mix in flour as little as possible to reduce gluten formation.  Pour into a well greased cast iron pan and bake on 400 &def;F for 25-30 min.

<blockquote><i>The following was requested by Grandpa so often, I added it to the book on principal.</i></blockquote>

<h2>Rhubarb Raisin Double Batch</h2>
<ul>
<p>1/2 cup butter / margarine (melted)
<p>2 cups milk = 500ml carton
<p>2 large eggs
<p>2 1/2 cups cornmeal = 500g bag
<p>2 cups all-purpose flour
<p>1 1/2 cups brown sugar
<p>2 tablespoon baking powder
<p>2 cups washed, diced, fresh rhubarb
<p>handful or two of raisins and cranberries
</ul>

</div>
<div id="CornFritter">
<h1>Corn Fritter</h1>

<p>This is essentially a corn pancake.

<p>&rarr; 1/2 cup'ish of flour (mix to consistency of pancake batter)
<p>&rarr; can of creamed corn
<p>&rarr; sugar to taste
<p>&rarr; salt to taste
<p>&rarr; 1 tablespoon of Baking Powder
<p>&rarr; 1 egg

<p>Mix everything to the consitency of pancake batter.  Fry like pancakes.

</div>
<div id="Flatbread">
<h1>Flat Bread aka Ash Cakes</h1>

<p>&rarr; flour - 1/2 cup per serving
<p>&rarr; salt - if you have it, to taste if you do
<p>&rarr; oil / fat / butter - up to 2 tablespoons per cup of flour - if you have it
<p>&rarr; milk if you have it, water if you don't ... enough to make a soft, dry dough ... a tich more if you want a sticky dough.

<p>The simplest dough is flour and water ... fancier doughs have more ingredients ... some have berries and nuts in them.

<p>Mix everything together.  Knead until smooth.  Cover and let rest for 30-60 min.  Make egg to palm sized balls.  Roll out flat to 1/8 inch (3 mm). 

<ul>
<li><p>Wrap on a stick and cook like a hotdog over the fire ... or

<li><p><i>If the dough is a little wet and sticky ... </i>Stick it to a hardwood board and prop it close enough to the fire to cook, turning occassionally.
<li><p>Pan fry in oil (15 min per side) ... or
<li><p>Bake on a greased pan at 350 &deg;F (175 &deg;C) for 25 to 30 min.

<h2>Roti Canai : Malaysian Flat Bread</h2>
<p>&rarr; 4 cups of flour
<p>&rarr; 1 egg
<p>&rarr; 3 tablespoons of melted butter (or oil)
<p>&rarr; 1 tablespoon of condensed milk (optional)
<p>&rarr; 1 - 1 1/4 cup of water


<p>Mix everything into a smooth dough, not too sticky but not dry either.
<p>Some peeps say it is important to kneed for 10 min and rest for 10 min
<p>Oil up a bowl, oil up your hands, roll the dough into palm sized balls.  Some peeps use butter, not oil.
<p>Cover them with a lid or saran wrap and let them sit overnight.
<p>The next day, oil up your hands, take a ball and kneed it out to dinner plate size.  Flip, twirl and stretch it like pizza dough.  You want it paper thin. 
<p>It often helps to coat it in oil or butter as you stretch it thinner and thinner.

<p>Fold it into halves atleast 3 times.  Put goodness in each layer if you like.
<p>Fry it in a pan with oil until golden brown.

<div id="RaisinBread">
<h2>Raisin Bread</h2>
<p>Grandma loves raisin bread.

<p>&rarr; 1 package or 2 teaspoons of dry yeast

<p>&rarr; 1/4 cup warm water
<p>&rarr; 1/2 cup warm milk
<p>&rarr; 1 cup raisins

<p>&rarr; 3-4 cups of flour

<p>Start adding flour and mixing with a spoon.

<p>Keeping adding and stirring as the dough shifts from soupy, to pasty, to wet dough and finally a soft, stiff dough (the surface will appear dry / covered in flour).

<p>Kneed the dough 10 minutes on a floured board.

<p>&rarr; Put the dough in a large, oiled bowl, cover it with a towel and set it somewhere warm and draft-free to rise.

<p>&rarr; Let it rise to x2 volume or about 1-1 1/2 hours.

<p>&rarr; Punch it down, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, divide it in half (2 equal loaves).

<p>&rarr; Put each loaf in a greased bread pan and let it rise (covered, warm, draft-free) until 2x volume or about an hr.

<p>&rarr; Bake @375 &deg;F or 190 &deg;C for 25 min.

<p>If it browns too quickly cover it with tin foil.

<h2><u>Variations</u></h2>

</ul>

<p>*** Grandma says you always (lightly) butter the crust when done and still warm enough to melt butter.

<p>All-Purpose flour makes a denser, coarser loaf closer in appearance and texture to biscuits.
