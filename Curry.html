<h2>Curry</h2>

<p>I can't recall having ever had curry growing up and I'm certain I've not made one for the family.  It is a true favorite though.  Mutton / Lamb curry ... I have had jobs in Malaysia and the Middle East where I eat at the little blue collar restaurants 4 nights a week just to have mutton curry each time.

<p>My partner in Malaysia taught me to make curry, though hers was far better.

<p>The first time I had curried crab (whole crabs in the curry) was in Malaysia with a friend and his family from Korea.  The single messiest dinner I have ever had.  We needed rain gear and had to take showers when we were done.  But good !!!

<p>I make all my curries the same way (depending on what's available) and only switch up the meat / veg option.  Seafood still rules.

<p>With a focus on one-pot-wonders, and my inherent efficiency (laziness), I do appreciate the pre-made curry pastes.  Takes so much of the unpleasant work out of making wonderful curries.


<h2>Curry Base</h2>

<p>&rarr; brown up meat / seafood in a little oil
<p>&rarr; in the case of 'in the shell' shellfish, crabs or such ... I steam them with the lid on and then reduce the water as best I can to save the goodness
<p>&rarr; saute a diced onion, ginger and garlic with meat / seafood, a little more oil maybe

<p>&rarr; throw in veg to your hearts' content (peeled if you like, chopped to size)
<p>&rarr; Simmer to taste / thickness of broth.

<tr><td>Pre-Made Flavored Curry Paste</td><td>Curry from Scratch</td>
<tr><td>
<p>&rarr; Complete pastes come in a 'brick' like a chocolate bar.  I break off 1 or 2 small squares for a small curry (good for me for 2 or 3 large meals) ... or more for larger pots ... this is a 'to taste' experience thing

<p>&rarr; Throw paste in, bring to desired volume using a mix of water and coconut milk.  More water is a thinner, more coconut milk is a thicker finished curry.  I usually do 50:50.

<p>&rarr; Mix paste in well, simmer / reduce to thickness, enjoy

</td><td>
<p>&rarr; add 3 parts lemon or lime juice
<p>&rarr; add 1 part curry paste ('raw' or unflavored)
<p>&rarr; add 1 part brown sugar (or less ... I like less)
<p>&rarr; add herbs and spices to taste

<p><i>For a small curry I would use teaspoons, for a large curry tablespoons, for a massive affair maybe cups ?  Experience will tell you, maybe start with a small curry and teaspoons the first time.</i>

<p>&rarr; Mix everything in well, tasting and modifying as you go
<p>&rarr; Simmer / reduce to thickness, enjoy
