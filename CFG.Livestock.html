<div id="Intro">
<p>Growing up, my immediate family, my mother, brother and sisters, never had livestock.  We had an endless supply of cats I was responsible for.  My brother had a rabbit that thought it was a cat.  And we had 2 dogs when we were very young.</p>
<p>The family up the road had oxen.  The Godfrey's had chickens, hundreds of chickens, that they shared.  Rosanne and Larry raised pigs that they shared.  I worked for Dennis and Grandpa.  They fished and hunted and shared what they got.</p>
<p>I use to visit Blake's house all the time.  He had, what seemed at the time, to be every animal on the planet.</p>
<p>I've shot or caught everything.  I've never had the chance to raise my own meat animals.  I'd like to.</p>
