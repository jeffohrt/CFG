<h1>Baked Beans</h1>

<p>Another of my childhood favorites is baked beans.  The first and arguably greatest compliment I have ever gotten was my grandmother having second helpings of my beans and then putting all the leftovers in the fridge with her leftovers (those are separate from the other leftovers).

<table>
<caption><h2>Old School vs Quick(ish)</h2></caption>

<td colspan=2 class="c">Rinse a quantity of beans.</td>

<td><p>&rarr; Simmer for 2.5 hrs.</td>

<td colspan=2 class="c">Beans are done when they are soft.</td>
</table>

<div class="solid">
<p>My favorite : Overnight soak, crockpot.  I don't have to watch it but takes longer so must start early.
<p>Grandma's favorite : Overnight soak, bake.  I have to watch it but it's faster so I can start later.
<p>Some peeps : Blanch, then simmer - still takes like 4 hrs and I have to watch it the whole time.
</div>

<h3>Proportions</h3>

<p>Place your quantity of dried beans in the cooking container.  This is roughly 1/4 the final volume.
<p>A proper soak will double the volume of the beans.
<p>The goodness adds even more.

<p><u>Typical for my family</u>
<p>A large crockpot can cook a 900g bag of dried beans to completion.  It's less than 1/2 full when soaking and more than 2/3 full when done.

<div class="solid">
<h2>The GOODNESS</h2>
<p>No matter what you are adding, bring the liquid level to just below the beans.  Add a little more during cooking if you like but not too much.  Soupy beans are not that great.

<ol>
<li><p>Bacon or Pork Fat to taste
   <p>Alternate Corned Beef - excellent - family didn't like it.
   <p>Alternate Hotdogs - did not work out
<li><p>Molasses or Maple Syrup to taste
<li><p>Ketchup, Tomato Soup, Spaghetti Sauce, BBQ Sauce
<p>Some, most or ALL - fill your boots.
<li><p>Mustard powder or just yellow mustard
<p>Alternate fancy mustards - I like the multi-colored seedy mustards.
<p>Diced Onion
